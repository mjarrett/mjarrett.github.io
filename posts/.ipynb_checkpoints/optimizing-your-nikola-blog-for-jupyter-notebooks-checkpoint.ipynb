    "You've installed [Nikola](https://getnikola.com). You've also followed [some instructions on how to use Jupyter notebooks as posts](https://mglerner.github.io/posts/switching-to-nikloa-for-jupyter-notebooks-and-a-static-site.html). Everything works! But after you make your first Jupyter post, the results are... uninspiring. The import prompts are ugly. If you've written I post designed primarily for the content, not the code, there's no was to turn off showing the code cells. This post will describe how I -- someone with almost no experience with javascript, CSS, etc -- made my blog more functional to work with Jupyter notebooks.\n",

    "Pick the theme you like best and install with `nikola theme -i theme_name`. I used the bootstrap3 theme. These instructions should work for any Bootstrap-based theme, and possible others though I haven't tested them.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new theme\n",
    "Nikola allows for theme inheritance, so we'll create a new theme that inherits from bootstrap3. This means in our new theme we only have to create the files we want to change, otherwise Nikola will fall back to the parent theme. Following the [official instructions](https://getnikola.com/creating-a-theme.html):\n",

    "\n",
    "This will create a new directory ```/themes/bootyper``` which is empty except for a file called bootyper.theme. You'll also be prompted to update your current theme in your conf.py file. Might as well do that now. While you're in conf.py, update the following sections. \n",

    "`cp ./themes/bootstrap4/templates/post.tmpl ./themes/bootyper/templates/post_ipynb.tmpl`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're free to modify the new template file, and it will only apply to posts that use Jupyter notebooks. First let's add a custom CSS file to the header. The post template we're using provides us with a block of code called \"extra_head\" which will be inserted into the end of the `<head>` element when the HTML is rendered. Let's link to our custom CSS file here\n",

    "# Clean up the Jupyter CSS\n",
    "We need to create the file we just linked to. Open a new file `./themes/bootyper/assets/css/bootyper.css`. This is where we'll stick our custom CSS that only applies to posts and pages made with Jupyter notebooks.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's totally up to you how to style your notebook. I totally ditch the input prompts, but instead you could just make them prettier than the default. I also change the styling of the input code blocks, and make the content div a little narrower so it's easier to read on wider screens. Finally I make embedded images the full width of the content div. I'm not much of a designer so I stop here, but the possibilities are of course endless.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Going further with Javascript\n",
    "The one thing I really wanted for my blog was to make it optional for the reader to see the raw code. Some posts would be designed as code-throughs, but others would be read mainly for the text and images and the code would be an extra for those interested. I've added two features to make this possible: 1) A button that toggles the visibility of the input code blocks, and 2) a metadata setting to set the default visibility of the code blocks on page load. Let's create a javascript library for these features in `./themes/bootyper/assets/js/bootyper.js`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\t$('div.input').show();\n",
    "    }\n",
    " code_show = !code_show\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function checks the value of the javascript variable `code_show` and either shows or hides the div with the input code, then switches the value of code_show. We'll run this function on page load, and then when the reader clicks on a button to show/hids the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to make another update to our template file `post_ipynb.tmpl`:\n",
    "```\n",

    "$( document ).ready(code_toggle);\n",
    "</%block>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here we've added a jquery library and our custom bootyper.js file. I've hard-coded in the default value of `code_show` as false, then I call the `code_toggle` function so that when the page loads the code cells aren't shown. Further down in the template file we can add a button to run this script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "    [...]\n",
    "</%block>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We're only adding the `<form>` element. I place the button immediately at the top of the content of the article, below the title and data/author. You can place it wherever you'd prefer, and give it any style you'd like. Again I just keep it simple and use a default bootstrap button style. And that's all it takes to have a button to optionally show or hide the input code in your Jupyter notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "# One more step: Nikola metadata\n",
    "Finally, I want to be able to set the default `code_show` value on a post by post basis. I do this using the notebook metadata. In Jupyter, go to Edit->Edit Notebook Metadata and you'll see see some JSON elements. By running `nikola add_post -i notebook.ipynb` to add your notebook as a Nikola post, Nikola will insert some custom fields into the JSON.

I keep my version of the bootyper theme on [github](https://github.com/mjarrett/bootyper). It contains the features show here plus a few extra features that aren't in the default theme. Some things I'd like to add in the future is having the code cells show some marker when they're hidden so the reader know's they're there, and also to have the toggle button float as the reader scrolls down the page."
