    "\n",
    "For over a year, I've been collecting real-time data about Mobi bike trips by monitoring public information about the number of bikes at each station and inferring trip activity based on changes to the number of bikes at each station. This has led to some fun uses: I have live figures updating constantly on [my website](data.mikejarrett.ca/mobi), a twitter bot tweets out daily stats at [@VanBikeShareBot](twitter.com/VanBikeShareBot), and a few [blog posts](http://notes.mikejarrett.ca/categories/mobi/).\n",
    "\n",
    "As handy as those live trip estimates are, they're very much estimates and only give us information about how often certain stations are used. Luckily, Mobi has started publishing open [system data](https://www.mobibikes.ca/en/system-data). This data set gives us a registry of every Mobi bikeshare trip since the beginning of 2017, current to the end of 2018 as of this writing. With this we have access to trip start and endpoints, trip duration and distance, membership type and more. In this post, I'll summarize some of the things I've learned after spending some time looking into this data.\n",

All these entitle the holder to unlimited 30 minute trips for the duration of the pass. Monthly, 90 day and annual members also have the option of buying a \"plus\" account, which entitles them to 60 minute trips.

Mobi tracks a trip's actual distance (presumably there's an odometer in the onboard computer) not just the point to point distance between stations. For annual members, we see a much tighter distribution with a peak around ~1km and tailing off to ~7km. Again, this is consistent with people using Mobis for transportation on trips not well served by transit. For daily users, the distribution is much broader, with a wide peak around 1-3km and a long tail out to 12km. We even see a bump around 10km, and it turns out ~10km trips are heavily dominated by the Stanly Park stations since that's about the distance around the Stanley Park seawall."

Prior to this expansion one of the main complaints that I heard during the inititial rollout was lack of East Van stations, so I was interested to see how much use these stations got once they appeared. To this end, I've divided stations into three groups: East (all stations east of Main), Core (downtown peninsula and the southern rim of False Creek south to about 6th Ave) and South (all station south of 6th and west of Main). Breaking out the southwest portion of the coverage area gives us a comparable area to East Van with lower density than the core and fewer tourist attractions than the downtown core and False Creek.

    "I've marked on the plot April 2018 when Mobi first advertised stations expanding into East Van. There were a handful of east of Main stations before then, but they only accounted for a small fraction of total trips. Since the East Van expansion, the fraction of trip starting in East Van has grown to be comparable to the South-West region. I might even argue that East Van has been responsible for a good chunk of Mobi's growth in the last year.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also break this down by how many trips per day the average station in each region sees. The small number of original East of Main stations were heavily used, but the addition of more East Van stations in lower density regions has made them on average used less often. As Mobi expands into less dense neighbourhoods, it's not surprising to see diminishing returns on ridership for each new station added. That said, the network effect is still important. Having stations reliably located throughout the region even in less dense areas is likely good for the health of the system as a whole."
